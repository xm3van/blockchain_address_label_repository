# Blockchain Address Label Repository
The `blockchain_address_label_repository` is a resource for primarily blockchain address label datasets and APIs, providing a structured collection of labelled address data, and access instructions for APIs and Datasets. Labels of Blockchain addresses can substantially help with sense-making as they enable the linking of real-world entities with on-chain activity. This repository's goal is to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers, developers, and analysts interested in studying address behaviour.

### Contents
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the repository, including its purpose, how to navigate the datasets, and instructions for using the APIs.
- `DATASETS.md`: Lists all the static datasets available with descriptions, metadata, and download links.
- `API_DOCS.md`: Detailed documentation for all the API endpoints, including usage examples, rate limits, and access requirements.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Outlines guidelines for contributing to the repository, including data submission, code additions, and documentation updates.
- `LICENSE`: Describes the usage rights and restrictions associated with the repository's content.

### Features
- **Curated List of Datasets**: Enumerates datasets with labelled Ethereum addresses, providing details on size, scope, format, and other relevant metadata.
- **API Integration**: Offers guidelines for accessing real-time data through APIs, complete with sample queries and response formats.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Encourages community contributions and outlines the process for submitting new data or updating existing entries.
